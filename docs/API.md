# BuonApp API Documentation

## Base URL

**Local:** `http://buonapp.local:3001` or `http://<local-ip>:3001`

The desktop app runs three HTTP servers on the local network, advertised over mDNS as `buonapp.local`:

| Port | Server | Serves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `3001` | Express API and WebSocket | Every endpoint documented here, plus the POS interface |
| `3002` | Standalone KDS | The kitchen display and its WebSocket. Enabled by default; with `kds_enabled` switched off, `/api/kds-info`, `/api/kitchen/*`, and `/api/kds/*` answer `403` |
| `3003` | Server App | The tableside handheld interface. It forwards a deliberately narrow allowlist of API calls to `:3001`, including `POST /api/printers/print-kot`, and of the table routes forwards only `GET /tables` |

None of the three should ever be reachable from the public internet.

  "name": "Sauce Options",
  "addons": [
    { "name": "Extra Cheese", "price": 20 },
    { "name": "No Onions", "price": 0 }
  ]
}
```

---

## Tables

### GET `/api/tables`
List all tables.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "tables": [
    { "id": "table-1", "name": "T1", "capacity": 4, "is_active": 1 }
  ]
}
```

---

### POST `/api/tables`
Create table. Owner/manager. Accepts `number` (or the legacy `name`), `capacity`, `room_id`,
`shape` (`rect`/`round`), `width`, `height`, `section`, `position_x`, `position_y`,
`kitchen_station_id`.

Without `room_id` the table joins the first room, creating one if none exists. Without a position it
is placed on the first free spot in that room; without a size it is sized from its seat count.

---

### PUT `/api/tables/:id`
Update table. Owner/manager. Only the fields present in the body are written, so an optional
field can be cleared by sending it as `""` or `null`. Renaming — or moving the table to another
room — retags the labels on the table's open orders; closed orders keep the label they were served
under. This is also how the map saves a drag: `{ "position_x": 320, "position_y": 180 }`.

---

### DELETE `/api/tables/:id`
Delete table for real. Owner/manager. History survives because each order carries its own
`table_label`/`room_label` snapshot; the order's `table_id` is set to `NULL`.

**Response (409):** refused while something live still points at the table.
```json
{ "error": "Cannot delete a table with an open order. Close or move the order first.",
  "code": "table_has_open_order" }
```
`code` is `table_has_open_order` or `table_has_held_cart`.

---

## Rooms

The dining rooms the map is drawn on. Sizes are abstract units, not pixels: the renderer scales a
room to the width it is given. See `docs/table-management.md`.

### GET `/api/rooms`
The whole floor: every room with its tables, each table carrying its live order. Any authenticated
role. Query: `tables=false` omits the tables, `active=1` hides deactivated rooms.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "rooms": [
    {
      "id": "room-a1b2c3d4", "name": "Sala Interna", "sort_order": 0,
      "width": 1200, "height": 800, "is_active": 1,
      "tables": [
        { "id": "tbl-1", "name": "T1", "capacity": 4, "status": "occupied",
          "position_x": 40, "position_y": 40, "width": 150, "height": 110, "shape": "rect",
          "activeOrder": { } }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "orphanTables": []
}
```
`orphanTables` holds any table with no room; it should stay empty, and is surfaced rather than
hidden so such a table can still be opened and assigned.

---

### POST `/api/rooms`
Create room. Owner/manager. Accepts `name` (required, unique), `width`, `height`, `sort_order`.
Sizes must be between 400 and 6000.

**Response (400):** `{ "code": "room_name_taken" }` when the name is in use.

---

### PUT `/api/rooms/:id`
Rename, resize or reorder a room. Owner/manager. Only the fields present in the body are written.

---

### DELETE `/api/rooms/:id`
Delete room. Owner/manager. Refused while it still holds tables, rather than scattering a floor plan
or deleting the tables behind one click.

**Response (409):** `{ "code": "room_not_empty", "tables": 6 }`

---

## Reservations

Bookings for the service being run right now, held against a table that exists. See
`docs/table-management.md`. A table's booking rides along on every read that returns tables
(`GET /tables`, `GET /tables/:id`, `GET /rooms`) as a `reservation` field.

### POST `/api/tables/:id/reserve`
Book a table. Owner/manager. `name` is required; `guests` defaults to 2; `booked_time` (`HH:MM`),
`phone`, `notes` and `customer_id` are optional. Re-posting replaces the standing booking, which is
how a name or a head count gets corrected.

**Response (400):** `reservation_name_required`, `reservation_time_invalid`
**Response (409):** `table_has_open_order` — the table is already serving.

---

### DELETE `/api/tables/:id/reserve`
Drop the standing booking and free the table. Owner/manager.

**Response (404):** `{ "code": "no_reservation" }`

---

### GET `/api/reservations`
The day's booking sheet, ordered the way the evening runs (timed first, then untimed).
Owner/manager. Returns `{ "day": null, "reservations": [] }` when no day is open.

---

### POST `/api/reservations`
Take a booking down. Owner/manager. `name` required, `guests` defaults to 2; `booked_time`
(`HH:MM`), `phone`, `notes`, `customer_id` and `table_id` are optional. Without a table the booking
waits on the sheet, which is the normal case.

---

### PATCH `/api/reservations/:id`
Edit a pending booking. Owner/manager. Only the fields sent are written.

**Response (409):** `{ "code": "reservation_not_pending" }`

---

### POST `/api/reservations/:id/assign`
Give the booking a table, or take its table away with `{ "table_id": null }`. Owner/manager.

Whatever was on the target table inherits what this booking had, so a swap is the same call as a
plain assignment. The response carries `displaced` when another booking had to move.

**Response (409):** `reservation_not_pending`, `table_has_open_order`, `table_is_merged`

---

### POST `/api/reservations/:id/cancel` · `/no-show` · `/reopen`
Close a pending booking, or put a seating made by mistake back on the sheet. Owner/manager.
Reopening returns the booking with no table, since the one it had is now busy.

**Response (409):** `reservation_not_seated` when reopening something that was never seated.

---

## Joined tables

### POST `/api/tables/:id/merge`
Push tables together for one party. Owner/manager. The table in the path leads the group and keeps
the order; `table_ids` lists the ones folded into it.

**Response (409):** `table_has_open_order`, `table_has_held_cart`, `table_has_reservation`,
`table_already_merged`, `table_leads_group` — the message names the table in the way.

---

### POST `/api/tables/:id/split`
Break the group up. Owner/manager. Works from the leader or from any member.

**Response (400):** `{ "code": "not_merged" }`

---

## Floor plans

Saved maps, so a room emptied at close can be rebuilt in one action.

### GET `/api/table-layouts`
List saved plans with their room and table counts. Owner/manager.

### POST `/api/table-layouts`
Save the floor as it stands, under `name`. Owner/manager. Re-using a name overwrites that plan.

**Response (400):** `layout_name_required`, `layout_empty`

### POST `/api/table-layouts/:id/apply`
Rebuild the floor from a plan. Owner/manager.

**Response (409):** `{ "code": "layout_apply_blocked", "blockers": [{ "number": "T6", "reason": "table_has_open_order" }] }`

### DELETE `/api/table-layouts/:id`
Delete a plan. Owner/manager.

---

## Service Days

The business-day cycle. Orders are stamped with the day that was open when they were placed, so a
service running past midnight stays one day. See `docs/table-management.md`.

### GET `/api/service-days/current`
The day being served, with live totals and what would block a close. Owner/manager.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "day": { "id": "sd-20260824-a1b2c3", "business_date": "2026-08-24", "status": "open" },
  "summary": { "orders": { "total": 42 }, "covers": 96, "takings": { "total": 1284.5 } },
  "blockers": { "openOrders": [], "unpaidBills": [] }
}
```
`day` is `null` when no day is open.

---

### GET `/api/service-days`
List days, newest first. Owner/manager. Query: `limit` (default 60, max 200), `offset`.
Rows carry `orders_count`, `covers` and `takings` for the picker.

---

### GET `/api/service-days/:id`
One day with its summary and orders. Owner/manager. A closed day reports the totals frozen at
close; an open or backfilled one reports totals computed live.

---

### POST `/api/service-days/open`
Open the day explicitly, attributing it to the caller. Owner/manager. Placing an order with no day
running opens one anyway — this exists so the opening has an operator, not to gate service.

**Response (409):** `{ "code": "service_day_already_open", "day": { ... } }`

---

### POST `/api/service-days/:id/close`
Close the day: freeze the totals, snapshot the room, clear held carts, free the tables.
Owner/manager.

**Body:** `{ "clear_tables": false, "force": false, "reason": null }`

`clear_tables` deletes the tables so the next day starts from a blank map. `force` is owner-only,
requires `reason`, and leaves open orders (and their tables) alone.

**Response (200):**
```json
{ "day": { "status": "closed" }, "summary": { }, "tablesCleared": 12, "tablesKept": 0, "heldCartsCleared": 1 }
```

**Response (409):** `{ "code": "service_day_has_blockers", "blockers": { "openOrders": [], "unpaidBills": [] } }`

---

### POST `/api/service-days/:id/reopen`
Reopen a closed day, dropping its frozen summary so totals go live again. Owner only, and only
when no other day is open.

---

### POST `/api/service-days/:id/print`
Print the closing report on the thermal printer. Owner/manager.

**Body:** `{ "preview": false, "useUnicode": false }` — `preview: true` returns the rendered text
instead of printing.

---

## Orders

### GET `/api/orders`
List orders.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Query params:**
- `?status=pending,preparing` - Filter by status
- `?date=2025-03-31` - Filter by date

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "order_number": "ORD-001",
      "type": "dine_in",
      "status": "pending",
      "table": { "id": "table-1", "name": "T1" },
      "items": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "product_name": "Cheeseburger",
          "quantity": 2,
          "status": "pending",
          "addons": [{ "id": "addon-1", "name": "Extra Cheese", "price": 20, "quantity": 1 }],
          "special_instructions": "No onions"
        }
      ],
      "created_at": "2025-03-31T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### POST `/api/orders`
Create new order.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Order item `addons` reference catalog add-ons by `id`. Each add-on must be active and linked to the product's add-on group. Add-on name and price are resolved from the catalog (client-supplied names and prices are ignored). Quantity defaults to `1` when omitted and must be a positive integer.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "type": "dine_in",
  "table_id": "table-1",
  "customer_id": "cust-1",
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "prod-1",
      "quantity": 2,
      "addons": [{ "id": "addon-1", "quantity": 1 }],
      "special_instructions": "No onions"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "order": { ... },
  "bill": { ... }
}
```

---

### GET `/api/orders/:id`
Get order details.

---

### PATCH `/api/orders/:id/status`
Update order status.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "preparing"
}
```

**Valid transitions:**

| Current status | Allowed next statuses |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| `pending` | `preparing`, `ready`, `served`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `preparing` | `ready`, `served`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `ready` | `served`, `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `served` | `completed`, `cancelled` |
| `completed` | none (terminal) |
| `cancelled` | none (terminal) |

Repeating a request for the order's current status is an idempotent no-op.
Cancelling an order requires a manager PIN when the order has progressed beyond
`pending` or any item is already in progress. Cancellation restores inventory
only for non-terminal items that recorded an inventory deduction; cancelled,
voided, and accounting-adjustment items are excluded.

---

## Held Orders

### GET `/api/held-orders`
List held orders. Requires an authenticated owner, manager, cashier, or waiter.

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "orders": [
    {
      "id": "ho-abc12345",
      "tableId": "table-1",
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "line-1",
          "product": { "id": "prod-1", "name": "Cheeseburger", "price": 250 },
          "quantity": 1,
          "addons": [],
          "special_instructions": ""
        }
      ],
      "customerId": null,
      "guestCount": 1,
      "orderNotes": "",
      "heldAt": "2025-03-31T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "skippedCount": 0
}
```

### POST `/api/held-orders`
Create or replace the held order for a table. The response `id` identifies the
specific row returned to the client; replacing an existing held order creates a
new identity. Requires an authenticated owner, manager, cashier, or waiter.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "tableId": "table-1",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "line-1",
      "product": { "id": "prod-1", "name": "Cheeseburger", "price": 250 },
      "quantity": 1,
      "addons": [],
      "special_instructions": ""
    }
  ],
  "customerId": null,
  "guestCount": 1,
  "orderNotes": ""
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "id": "ho-abc12345"
}
```

### DELETE `/api/held-orders/:tableId?heldOrderId=:id`
Consume the held order only when `heldOrderId` matches the current row. A
matching request deletes the row, releases the table, and returns
`{"success":true,"deleted":true}`. Requests without an identity, for an
already-consumed row, or for a replacement row return
`{"success":true,"deleted":false}` without deleting the current row or
releasing the table. Requires an authenticated owner, manager, cashier, or
waiter.

---

## Order Items

### PATCH `/api/orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/cancel`
Cancel an order item.

- A cancellable item outside `preparing` or `ready` becomes `cancelled` and
  restores its recorded inventory deduction.
- An item in `preparing` or `ready` becomes `voided`, adds a negative
  `void_adjustment` bill line, and does not restore inventory; a manager PIN is
  required for the void.
- A new cancellation on a completed, cancelled, paid, or partially paid order
  is rejected. Repeating cancellation of a terminal item is an idempotent
  no-op for an owner or manager.

### PATCH `/api/orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/restore`
Restore a cancelled item (owner or manager only). The item returns to `pending`
and its recorded inventory deduction is applied again. The request fails when
the order is terminal, the order is paid, or available stock is insufficient.

### POST `/api/orders/:id/items`
Append items to an existing order.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

For a retry-safe append, send an `Idempotency-Key` header containing 1–128 printable, non-whitespace ASCII characters. Reuse the same key only for the same authenticated user's identical append request (order, items, and order notes) until its response is confirmed. A matching retry returns the original `200` response without adding items again, including if the order has since become non-editable; reusing the key for different data returns `409`.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "product_id": "prod-1",
      "quantity": 2,
      "addons": [{ "id": "addon-1", "quantity": 1 }],
      "special_instructions": "No onions"
    }
  ],
  "special_instructions": "Add drinks when ready"
}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "order": { "id": "order-1", "items": [ ... ] }
}
```

---

### PATCH `/api/order-items/:id/status`
Update item status (KDS workflow).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "status": "preparing"
}
```

**Valid statuses:** `pending` → `preparing` → `ready` → `served`

---

## Order Discounts

### PATCH `/api/orders/:id/discount`
Apply order-level discount.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "discount_type": "percentage",
  "discount_value": 10,
  "discount_reason": "Happy hour"
}
```

**Validations:**
- `discount_type`: must be `"percentage"` or `"amount"`
- `discount_value`: must be positive; cannot exceed store limits (`discount_max_percentage`, `discount_max_amount`)
- `discount_mode` setting is checked — if `'flat'`, percentage discounts are rejected; if `'percentage'`, flat discounts are rejected
- If `discount_requires_approval` is true, `override_pin` (manager/owner PIN) is required
- Order must exist and not be completed/cancelled

**Error (400):**
```json
{ "error": "Percentage discounts are disabled" }
```

**Error (403) — approval required:**
```json
{ "error": "Manager PIN required for discounts", "requiresApproval": true }
```

---

### PATCH `/api/orders/:id/items/:itemId/discount`
Apply item-level discount.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "discount_type": "amount",
  "discount_value": 25,
  "discount_reason": "Comp item"
}
```

**Validations:** Same as order-level discount.

---

## Bills

### GET `/api/bills`
List bills.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Query params:** `?date=2025-03-31&payment_status=paid`

---

### POST `/api/bills`
Create bill (after order completion).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "order_id": 1,
  "payment_method": "cash",
  "amount_tendered": 500
}
```

---

### PATCH `/api/bills/:id/pay`
Mark bill as paid.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "payment_method": "cash",
  "amount_tendered": 500
}
```

---

### POST `/api/bills/:id/applyDiscount`
Apply discount to a bill (owner/manager only).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "type": "percentage",
  "value": 10,
  "reason": "Happy hour"
}
```

**Validations:**
- `type`: must be `"percentage"` or `"amount"`
- `value`: must be positive; cannot exceed store limits (`discount_max_percentage`, `discount_max_amount`)
- `discount_mode` setting is checked — restricts which discount types are allowed
- If `discount_requires_approval` is true, `override_pin` is required
- Updates both bill and order in a transaction

**Error (400):**
```json
{ "error": "Discount exceeds maximum allowed" }
```

}
```

**Error response:**
```json
{
  "type": "auth_error",
  "message": "Invalid token"
}
```

### REST (Fallback) `GET /api/kitchen/orders`
Fetch kitchen orders (REST fallback for cloud/web).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Query params:** `?status=pending,preparing,ready,served`

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "orders": [...],
  "counts": {
    "pending": 5,
    "preparing": 3,
    "ready": 1,
    "served": 10
  }
}
```

## Customers

### GET `/api/customers`
List customers.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Query params:** `?search=John&phone=9876543210`

---

### POST `/api/customers`
Create customer. Returns `403` with `code: "customers_disabled"` when the
`customers_enabled` setting is off (the business keeps no customer book).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "phone": "+919876543210",
  "email": "john@email.com"
}
```

---

### DELETE `/api/customers/:id`
Erase a customer for good (owner/manager). The row is removed, not flagged
inactive. Orders, bills, held orders, reservations and WhatsApp messages keep
their amounts and only lose the link, so reporting totals are unaffected; the
customer's loyalty ledger is deleted with them.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "deleted": true,
  "detached_orders": 12,
  "discarded_ledger_entries": 3,
  "discarded_wallet_balance": 40
}
```

---

### GET `/api/customers/:id/loyalty`
Get loyalty points.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "points": 150,
  "last_activity": "2025-03-30"
}
```

---

### POST `/api/customers/:id/loyalty/earn`
Earn loyalty points.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "points": 10,
  "description": "Order #123"
}
```

---

## Reports

The owner dashboard these once fed is gone; a service day's own close summary
(`GET /api/service-days/:id`) is where a restaurant reads its numbers. What
remains here is the money read side over a date range. Both are
owner/manager only. Dates are UTC `YYYY-MM-DD`; a malformed date falls back to
today rather than erroring.

### GET `/api/reports/summary`
One day's takings. **Query params:** `?date=2026-03-31` (defaults to today).

**Response:**
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "date": "2026-03-31",
    "orders": { "count": 45, "total": 15000 },
    "bills": { "count": 44, "total": 14800, "collected": 14650 },
    "customers": { "new": 3 },
    "ordersByStatus": [{ "status": "completed", "count": 42 }],
    "paymentMethods": [{ "method": "cash", "count": 20, "total": 6400 }]
  }
}
```

---

### GET `/api/reports/sales`
Takings over a range, split by day, payment method and order type. Payment
lines are attributed to their own timestamp, falling back to the bill's
`paid_at` then `created_at`.

**Query params:** `?start_date=2026-03-01&end_date=2026-03-31`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "sales": {
    "startDate": "2026-03-01",
    "endDate": "2026-03-31",
    "dailySales": [{ "date": "2026-03-01", "orders": 45, "total": 15000 }],
    "byPaymentMethod": [{ "method": "cash", "count": 320, "total": 98400 }],
    "byOrderType": [{ "type": "dine_in", "count": 400, "total": 120000 }]
  }
}
```

---

## Settings

### GET `/api/settings/business`
Get business settings. Locale display preferences (`currency_display`, `number_digits`, `calendar`) are resolved against the active country's declared `localeOptions`; stale or unsupported stored values are normalized to neutral defaults.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "business_name": "My Restaurant",
  "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
  "currency": "INR",
  "country": "IN",
  "tax_registration_number": "22AAAAA0000A1Z5",
  "currency_display": "rial",
  "number_digits": "locale",
  "calendar": "locale"
}
```

---

### PUT `/api/settings/business`
Update business settings.

`timezone` is validated as an IANA identifier; invalid values return HTTP 400 with `"Invalid timezone, currency, or country"`.

`tax_registration_number` is the business registration number printed on the bill header (P.IVA, VAT, GSTIN…). It is stored and printed verbatim — nothing validates or computes with it.

Locale display preferences (`currency_display`, `number_digits`, `calendar`) are validated against the effective country's `localeOptions`. Unsupported values return HTTP 400 with `"Invalid <key> for country <code>"`. Changing the country normalizes any previously stored preferences that are not supported by the new country to their neutral defaults (`rial`, `locale`, `locale`).

---

### GET `/api/settings/discount`
Get discount limits configuration.

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Response (200):**
```json
{
  "discount_max_percentage": 50,
  "discount_max_amount": 100,
  "discount_mode": "both",
  "discount_requires_approval": false
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `discount_max_percentage` | number | Max % for percentage discounts (0 = no limit) |
| `discount_max_amount` | number | Max flat amount for discounts (0 = no limit) |
| `discount_mode` | string | `'percentage'`, `'flat'`, or `'both'` — which discount types are allowed |
| `discount_requires_approval` | boolean | Require manager PIN to apply discounts |

---

### PUT `/api/settings/discount`
Update discount limits (owner/manager only).

**Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "discount_max_percentage": 30,
  "discount_max_amount": 200,
  "discount_mode": "both",
  "discount_requires_approval": true
}
```

**Validation:**
- `discount_max_percentage`: float, range 0–100 (0 = no limit)
- `discount_max_amount`: float, range 0–999999 (0 = no limit)
- `discount_mode`: must be `'percentage'`, `'flat'`, or `'both'`
- `discount_requires_approval`: boolean

**Error (400):**
```json
{ "error": "discount_mode must be \"percentage\", \"flat\", or \"both\"" }
```

## Printers

Printer configuration is available to owners and managers. Receipt and KOT print endpoints also allow cashiers. See [Printer setup](printers.md) for the operational guide.

### GET `/api/printers`

List configured printers, with their resolved printer profile.

### GET `/api/printers/detect`

Detect available USB and network printers.

### GET `/api/printers/supported`

List BuonApp's known printer profiles.

### GET `/api/printers/:id`

Get one configured printer.

### POST `/api/printers`

Create a printer. `connection_type` must be `network`, `usb`, or `webusb`. Network printers require `ip_address`.

```json
{
  "name": "Kitchen Printer",
  "connection_type": "network",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "port": 9100,
  "paper_width": "80mm",
  "is_default": true
}
```

A WebUSB entry stores the paper-width preference; the browser selects the physical device.

### PUT `/api/printers/:id`

Update printer configuration. The request accepts the same fields as creation.

### DELETE `/api/printers/:id`

Delete a configured printer.

### POST `/api/printers/:id/set-default`

Make a printer the default for regular receipt printing.

### POST `/api/printers/:id/test`

Send a test page. For WebUSB, the response contains the ESC/POS bytes for the browser to send.

### POST `/api/printers/print-bill`

Print the bill identified by `billId` or the bill associated with `orderId`.

```json
{
  "billId": 123,
  "useUnicode": false,
  "isReprint": false,
  "preview": false
}
```

Pass `preview: true` to generate receipt preview text, base64 ESC/POS payload, and column metrics without dispatching to a physical printer. If no hardware printer is configured, preview mode falls back to default 80 mm formatting.

### POST `/api/printers/print-kot`

Send a kitchen ticket for `orderId`. By default only the order rows that have never been sent go out: they are stamped with the next sequential round number (`order_items.kot_batch`) and routed to the configured kitchen stations, so a second round prints the newly added items and nothing else. Cancelled and voided rows are never included. This endpoint returns `403` when KOT printing is disabled.

```json
{
  "orderId": 123,
  "useUnicode": false
}
```

Pass `batch` to re-print a round that already went out (paper jam, lost slip). A re-print reuses the stored rows and does not issue a new round number.

```json
{
  "orderId": 123,
  "batch": 2
}
```

A caller may still provide `stationName` and `items` to force a single ad-hoc ticket; that form bypasses station routing and the round ledger entirely.

Successful responses report what actually happened. When there is nothing new to send — a double tap, or every item already with the kitchen — the response is `200` with `printed: false` rather than an error.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "printed": true,
  "batch": 2,
  "item_count": 3,
  "warnings": []
}
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "printed": false,
  "reason": "nothing_pending",
  "warnings": []
}
```

`reason` is `nothing_pending` for a normal send with an empty queue, or `batch_not_found` when a re-print names a round that does not exist. If the print fails, the round claim is released so the rows return to the queue and the cashier can simply send again.

Owners, managers, cashiers, and servers may call this route. The `server` role is included because on a handheld, sending the order is the act of firing the ticket; the Server App on port `3003` forwards `POST /api/printers/print-kot` to this endpoint for exactly that reason. Receipt printing (`print-bill`) remains closed to servers.

## KDS Info

### GET `/api/kds-info`
Get KDS access URLs and QR code.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "mdns_url": "http://buonapp.local:3001/kds",
  "ip_url": "http://192.168.1.50:3001/kds",
  "qr_url": "http://192.168.1.50:3001/kds",
  "qr_data_url": "data:image/png;base64,..."
}
```

## WebSocket Events Summary

| Event | Direction | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `auth` | → Server | Authenticate with JWT token |
| `auth_success` | ← Server | Authentication successful |
| `auth_error` | ← Server | Authentication failed |
| `initial_data` | ← Server | Initial orders and counts |
| `new_order` | ← Server | New order created |
| `order_updated` | ← Server | Order status changed |
| `status_update` | → Server | Update item status |
| `orders` | ← Server | Full orders list (periodic) |

---

## Order Status Flow

The order-level transition matrix is documented with
`PATCH /api/orders/:id/status` above. The KDS item progression is
`pending` → `preparing` → `ready` → `served`; cancellation and void statuses
are documented in the Order Items section.

Each item in an order has its own status, allowing:
- Multiple items in one order
- Different items at different stages
- KDS shows items filtered by status

---

## Role-Based Access

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| `owner` | Full access, user management, settings |
| `manager` | Most features, limited settings |
| `cashier` | POS, orders, bills |
| `waiter` | Orders, tables |
| `chef` | KDS only |

---

## Category Filtering (KDS)

Users with `chef` role have `category_ids` array. When accessing KDS:
1. Server validates JWT token
2. Server checks role is `chef`, `manager`, or `owner`
3. Server filters order items to only show products in user's categories
4. One user can have multiple categories

Example: Chef1 (cat-1, cat-2) only sees Food and Beverages items.

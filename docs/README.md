# BuonApp documentation index

This index classifies documentation in `docs/` so contributors and AI agents know which documents describe current runtime behavior, which describe planned designs, and which are historical records.

## Document authority

- **CURRENT**: Primary documentation for current supported behavior, setup, and developer workflows.
- **ACTIVE DESIGN**: Approved architecture currently being implemented. These describe target states that may be partially ahead of current code.
- **FORWARD-LOOKING**: Architecture proposals and plans that do not yet represent runtime contracts.
- **HISTORICAL**: Point-in-time audits, design records, or superseded specifications retained for context. Do not use these to drive new implementation unless an approved task or issue explicitly directs it.

> **Source of truth principle**: Current code and automated tests define what BuonApp does now. Approved task descriptions and GitHub issues define what a specific change is intended to accomplish. Cross-project invariants in `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT` documentation govern broader constraints.
